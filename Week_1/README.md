# CS50 Week 1 - Introduction to C

This repository contains my solutions for Harvard's CS50 Week 1 problem sets: "Pennies" and "Super Mario (More Comfortable)".

## Problem Descriptions

### Pennies (Change Calculator)

In this problem set, we create a program that calculates the least number of coins required to give a user change. The program assumes only coins of denominations 1, 5, 10, and 25 cents are available.

### Super Mario (More Comfortable)

This problem set involves creating a program that prints out a double half-pyramid of a specified height.

## Getting Started

To run these solutions, you'll need a C compiler. If you're on a Linux or Mac system, you might already have GCC installed. If you're on Windows, you might want to install something like MinGW.

## Compiling

To compile the code, navigate into the directory containing "pennies.c" or "supermario.c" and run the following command:

```sh
gcc -o pennies pennies.c
gcc -o supermario supermario.c
```

This will create an executable in the current directory.

## Running

To run the executables, use:

```sh
./pennies
./supermario
```

Each program will prompt you for input:

 - Pennies: Enter the number of cents.
 - Super Mario: Enter the height of the pyramid.

Please ensure to enter valid input as prompted.
