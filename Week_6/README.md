# CS50 Week 6 - Python
This repository contains my solutions for the problem sets from Harvard's CS50 Week 6.

## Problem Descriptions
In Week 6, we switch gears and explore Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. The problems included in this repository are:

### cash.py: A program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change, similar to the "Pennies" problem from Week 1 but now implemented in Python.

### mario-more.py: A program that prints out a double half-pyramid of a specified height, just like in the "SuperMario (More Confident)" problem from Week 1 but now in Python.

### dna.py: A program that identifies a person based on their DNA sequence. This program will open a DNA sequence and a CSV file containing STR counts for a list of individuals and then output to whom the DNA (most likely) belongs.

### readability.py: A program that computes the Coleman-Liau index of the text and outputs the grade level for the text as an integer. Similar to the "Readability" problem from Week 4, but now implemented in Python.

## Getting Started
To use these programs, you need Python installed on your system. If it is not installed, you can download Python from here.

## Running
To run the programs, navigate to the directory containing the python files and use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
python3 filename.py
```

 - Where filename.py can be cash.py, mario-more.py, dna.py, or readability.py. 
 - dna.py needs one more argument which is the .txt or .csv data file. 
```sh
python dna.py data.csv
```

Please ensure to enter valid file paths and names.
