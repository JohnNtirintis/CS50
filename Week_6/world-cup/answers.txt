Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The more the simulations increased the the more the results differed from the begginning.
The 10 and 100 simulations proved incorrect.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It's difficult to say really. But i would go with either 10k or 100k simulations.
They seem the most time efficient and yet still are plenty of simulations going on for the data/results
to be somewhat reliable.
