# CS50 Week 5 - Data Structures
This repository contains my solution for the problem set "Trie" from Harvard's CS50 Week 5.

## Problem Description
In Week 5, we delve into the world of Data Structures. For this problem, we focus on a particular data structure called a "Trie", which is a type of search tree. An efficient way to save and retrieve data, Tries are particularly useful for storing dictionaries.

The challenge here is to build a dictionary data structure using Trie and implement loading, checking, unloading, and calculating the size of the dictionary.

## Getting Started
To use this program, you will need a C compiler. If you're on a Linux or Mac system, you might already have GCC installed. If you're on Windows, you might want to install something like MinGW.

## Compiling
To compile the code, navigate to the directory containing "trie.c" and run the following command:

```sh
gcc -o trie trie.c
```

This will create an executable file in the current directory.

## Running

To run the executable, use:

```sh
./trie dog_names.txt
```

Please ensure to enter valid file paths and names.
